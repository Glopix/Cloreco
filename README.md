# Automatic Benchmarking of Clone Detectors (ABCD) platform
This web platform can be used to execute one or multiple code clone detector tools on one or multiple clone benchmark frameworks. 
Their configurations can be set directly in the web interface.  
Containers are used to run the clone detector tools in an isolated environment while ensuring reproducibility of execution.

The execution artefacts (settings, recognised clones, evaluation results, etc.) can be downloaded via the platform.

The platform includes various code clone detection tools and clone benchmark frameworks. You can extend your instance with more of these tools and frameworks. Code clone detection tools can be added directly through the web interface.

Further information can be found in the [Wiki](https://github.com/Glopix/abcd/wiki), including information on how to set it up.

## Setup

## Images
The images of the already containerized code clone detector tools and clone benchmark frameworks are available in [this repository](https://github.com/Glopix/abcd-images).
