[benchmark-argument-descriptions]
max_files = The maximum number of files this tool can handle. If the number of benchmark files exceeds this limit, the benchmark dataset will be automatically divided into multiple partitions to bypass the tool's scalability constraints.
logging_verbose = Save stdout and stderr of the detector tool in a log file? (true or false)

[detector-argument-descriptions]
level = specifies the granularity of the index. <br>Accepted values: "method" or "statement"
compressed = specifies whether the index is compressed or not. <br>Accepted values: "true" or "false"
persistent = specifies whether the index is built in main memory or on secondary storage. <br>Accepted values: "true" or "false"
minSize = specifies the minimum number of lines; for example, if minSize is 5, the code fragment must have at least 5 lines to be reported
ignoreUnaryAtLiterals = specifies how the unary plus and minus are treated. <br>Accepted values: "true" or "false"
ignoreAnnotations = specifies whether annotations in code are taken into account. <br>Accepted values: "true" or "false"
treatNullAsLiteral = specifies how "null" is treated. <br>Accepted values: "true" or "false"
treatSuperThisAsIdentifier = specifies whether "super" and "this" are treated as identifiers. <br>Accepted values: "true" or "false"
treatVoidAsType = specifies how "void" is treated. <br>Accepted values: "true" or "false"
batchFileSize = specifies how many files are processed before the index in memory is merged with the persistent index
index = specifies the type of index. <br>Accepted values: "full" or "simplified". For the method-level clone detection, it will be "simplified".
rename = specifies how identifiers are renamed. <br>Accepted values: "blind" or "consistent". <br>"blind" means that all identifiers will be considered equal (renamed clones will be reported), and the value of "consistent" means that identifiers will be systematically renamed (parameterized clones will be reported).
